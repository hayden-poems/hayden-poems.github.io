  <h1>Welcome to my Poetry scrapbook</h1>

<p>
  Today is World Poetry Day so I thought I'd share a few of my poems.
  The Majority of these poems were written in 2018 when I was staying in Pisa.
  I will add new poems now and then.
  As my writing style is to create a quick flowing poem in one (mosty) and as I am an awful proof reader
  , the poems with constantly be  edited and updated, some may become even more streamlined and others more bulky,however I 
  will be keeping the raw unedited versions and may in the future upload them as a insight into my creative process.
  Please also check out my interesting links page which lists some poets I'm reading at the moment and some general sources for poetry.
</p>

    Enjoy reading! Hayden
