  <h1>Welcome to my Poetry scrapbook</h1>

<p>
  Today is World Poetry Day so I thought I'd share a few of my poems.
  The majority of these poems were written in 2018 when I was staying in Pisa.
  I will add new poems now and then.
  As my writing style is to create a quick flowing poem in one (mosty) and 
  as I am an awful proof reader,
  the poems with constantly be  edited and updated, 
  some may become even more streamlined and others more bulky,
  however I will be keeping the raw unedited versions
  which may in the future upload them as a insight into my creative process.
  Please also check out my interesting links page which lists some poets I'm reading at the moment and some general sources for poetry.

   Some of the poems touch  on the vile bigotry and racism the black community has faced for centuries.
  We need to face ourselves and admit we have a lot to learn and although we will never fully understand the atrocities faced
  we all have a responsibility to be actively anti racist. So here are two  links with resources for us to educate ourselves with,
  causes to donate to and campaigns to support to show our solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement 
    [Black Lives Matter Carrd](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/)

    Enjoy Reading! Hayden.
