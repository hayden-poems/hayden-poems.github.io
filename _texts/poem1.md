- Protests attended to glimpse your face 
- Willpower not to shake as we  shared a comrades embrace
- Fighting for a cause you believe in 
- Heavy causes with heavy breathing 
- Do I really care for the fight for equality ?
- Or am I just in love with your vitality?
- Protest turned to Skirmish 
- Woke to Wake 
- You were never my mistake to make 
- The void  you left I fill with your fight 
- Waiting to rediscover your light
