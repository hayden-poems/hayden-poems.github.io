- 
- High up a vine entangled tower lived a man
- His Chalk white face, ambushed by time
- In his shaking hands rested a glass of Chardonnay wine.
- From his elevated height , he failed to see the troubles of the night 
- Excluded and Deluded
- Manic Scribbles of words
- ALL Jumbled 
- ALL Absurd
- No one paid note to another old man on his unsteady perch
- Meaningless words from a Meaningless height
