title: Sorry is not enough
author: Hayden Strawbridge

Dear George Floyd sorry is not enough
Us whites with the hour glass memories too easily forgetting that you and your ancestors have always had it tough
The undeserved and sickly  privilege we have had for an age needs to shatter under the pressure of our collective rage.
How can there be any silence when Bigotry and evil has caused such suffering.
Time and time and time repeating itself
Lessons not learned just hatred rising

It's time to smash the clock before the chimes of suffering are heard again
Wake us all up from the zombie like acceptance
None of this is acceptable
Humanity cannot survive this much injustice
Enough is enough
Inequality has had its day
It's paramount we all stand and have our say
Solidarity to my brothers and sisters whoever they may be, power to you all if equality, anger,pain and change is in the forefront of your mind

We will never fully understand your suffering 
but we must must try to realise that unless we unite and show others the sinister stupidity of counting invisible petty  differences  instead of being supportive  kind and as one , Bigotry, fear, ignorance and racism will always stare and glare on in  some people's minds.
Your death, the death of an innocent man by the brutal White heat anger of a so called authority figure will not and cannot be forgotten

Let's make sure your death isn't made even more of a waste by  apathy and inaction
Change is the only way.
Rest in peace Brother, father, son, friend and symbolism of  a guilty Broken America and perhaps  a broken guilty  World.
