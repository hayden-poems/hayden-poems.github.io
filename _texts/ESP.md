title: Edgy Selfish Platitudes 
---
- The Metro used to fuel Tory pride 
- Stacked by the makeshift bed of a Portuguese idealist.
- Now used to fuel the warmth of the forgotten.
- Uncomfortable words, Inconvienient truths.
- Another eyesore on the daily commute.
- Faces shift away , advoidance the best strategy.
The glimpse of humanity sparked around a pile of burning newspapers.
A simple invitation through Chattering teeth.
- "Fancy sharing my warmth"?
