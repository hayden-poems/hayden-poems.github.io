title: Drowning of the Keen 
author: Hayden Strawbridge
---

- Footsteps that used to soar 
- Now broken and faded by the front door
- The door handle wouldn't turn
- All the excitement and belief was trapped and about to burn
- I used to try but these days I just cry
- Eager actions turned to cynical words
- Pure passion filled determination decays to blind aggression
- How can we unite if everyone is fighting a slightly different fight?
- The water rises as our energy fades like the light
- The manic  splashes of the naive turn to the  stillness of the bereaved
- The drowning of the keen
