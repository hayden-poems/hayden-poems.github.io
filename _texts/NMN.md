title: No more novelty  
---
- The aged traveller gave out a forlorn sigh
- Looked up at the over familiar sky.
- Then uttered in a wise an almost Clemintine voice
- I never stop I constantly move from old to new.
picking up things like a current 
- From comfort to the unknown
- For I am the Grand Traveller who always must be on the move
- If I ceased to travel I'd die.
- The old sparkling eyes of the Grand Traveller began to flow.
- He had seen EVERYTHING , so he had to finish his trip.
- He sat down under a tree and ceased to be.
