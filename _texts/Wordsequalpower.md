author: Hayden Strawbridge

-
- It is time to speak up
- This time as one
- Unite for the rebirth of kind humanity
- The shoots of hope break through the once barren earth.
- The Power of all our voices is immense
- Everyone uttering the same message in unison
- We shall never be silenced
- So if you are reading this poem and your heart beat matches the rhythm of equality
- Join us in the creation of a kinder more empathetic community.
- Let's build this word anew
- No more can we be dictated by a bigoted few
- Our voices won't be silenced
- The uplifting noise of many feet marching as one
- Stops the pathetic whimper of the few ignorant Bigots
- Change is coming no matter what
- The future is equalityÂ
