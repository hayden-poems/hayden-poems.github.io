title: The Buffet of Ideology  
---
Some sit for a while  in thoughtful  silence 
While others  dive straight in manically determined
Many stick to well knowns, stay in the same area they always have picking their old favourites to eat. 
Taking safety from memories of eating  the same food year after year.
While some experiment  moving to a different  area and  trying something new learn a  flavour they had yet encountered.
Some eat little  just enough to taste it for a second, thinking they know  what its all about 
Others  take their time savouring  savouring  specific flavours and gaining a better understanding.
Most of them stay  in their corner failing to understand why the others favour a different snack that is obviously inferior.
Wiser perhaps are the few moving between the different areas from the lefthand side towards the right, cherry picking  the food that's  good amongst all the duds.
Dodging the many stubborn and stationary people consistently eating the same food.
Its often a good idea to step back  from the table to see the varied array of food from the far left and the far right, most looking enticing from this distance
Yet on closer scrutiny the flaws and mould show the decay of decent food into food past its time, 
even with these obvious faults people could only see the gains they could get from it.
