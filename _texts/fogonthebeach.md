title: Fog on the Beach
author: Hayden Strawbridge
---
- Fog slowly glooming over dazzling water cut sand
- It makes it seem like a mystical land
- Until realisation hits
- Not natural no but man made smog
- It's not salt you taste on your tongue from sea fog but the fizz of radiation 
-  In amongst the clouded view lies the source of it all, a nuclear power plant
- A notion like that of the nuclear family that may just become fog in the air
