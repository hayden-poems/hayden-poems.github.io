title: Flawed Foundations  
author: Hayden Strawbridge
---

-Some countries blindly pile prestige upon prestige

-Forgetting or purposely overlooking what the country was built upon

-POWER FROM FEAR

-STRENGTH FROM DIVISION

- PRIDE FROM BIGOTRY

-The very fabric that created these countries is corrupt

-The values that thinly hide the inequality and hatred crumble under moral scrutiny

-The demise if the flawed foundatiions a victory for HUMANITY
